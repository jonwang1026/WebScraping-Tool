# WebScraping-Tool
Basic Web Scraping Stored in Various Data Structures

## Some important modifications in this program you would like to change:
    -Will need to modify the default website ("http://compsci.mrreed.com") to the website you desire
    
    -Currently the program supports 4 types of data structures, and will iteratre 
      through each data structure to determine time complexity ran on each data structure. If you would like to only run a
      specific data structure, feel free to remove them on line 49, and choose the one you'd like from the list.
    
    -Lines 85-89 are optional and can be implemented if there is a search_list that you desire.
    
    -I have inlcuded a default sample of the time complexity on the default website in the folder to use as reference.
